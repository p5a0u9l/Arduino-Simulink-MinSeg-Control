This repository contains work, references, and projects from the graduate course  [EE547: Linear Systems Theory](https://www2.ee.washington.edu/news/2013/PMP_EE_547.html) offered at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Winter 2015.

## MinSeg Demonstration

Demonstration of real-time control loop balancing a Lego-kit MinSeg, project for master's course at UW in Linear Control Theory.

The [SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) is an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) running
a C-compiled model developed in [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) using hardware drivers
provided by [Mathworks](https://www.mathworks.com/) and a [Lego-kit](http://minseg.com/) originally developed at Rensselaer.
